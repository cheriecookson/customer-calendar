# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description

The scheduler displays the current day and lists work day hours starting from 9 AM and to 5 PM.  Each hour has an input field that allows you to add events for that hour.  Each hour will be highlighted to indicate if the hour is occuring in the present, past or future.
